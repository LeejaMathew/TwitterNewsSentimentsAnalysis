# TwitterNewsSentimentsAnalysis
We have created a Shiny app that will run a certain phrase through a sentiment analysis, which uses the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier with a set time and location. The goal was to retrieve our own data from the Twitter API and determine how people are feeling toward a specific subject in real time at different locations.
